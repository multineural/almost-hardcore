# almost-hardcore
Minecraft mod for fabric (requires fabric-api) giving players a hardcore game experience with a limited number of lives.

## TODOs:
1. Persist the number of lives a player has
2. Add starting and max lives configurations
3. Add /ahc.gift command
4. Add beacon/potion effect whereby the same old totem of undying effect is applied to any player in the beacon range.
5.
